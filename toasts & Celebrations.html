                <em>Now, in a breath, we’ll burst those gates of gold,</em>
                <em>And ransack heaven before our moment fails.</em>
                <br>
                <em>Now, in a breath, before we, too, grow old,</em>
                <em>We’ll mount and sing and spread immortal sails.</em>
                <br>
                <em>It is not time that makes eternity.</em>
                <em>Love and an hour may quite out-span the years,</em>
                <br>
                <em>And give us more to hear and more to see</em>
                <em>Than life can wash away with all its tears.</em>
                <br>
                <em>Dear, when we part, at last, that sunset sky</em>
                <em>Shall not be touched with deeper hues than this;</em>
                <br>
                <em>But we shall ride the lightning ere we die</em>
                <em>And seize our brief infinitude of bliss,</em>
                <br>
                <em>With time to spare for all that heaven can tell,</em>
                <em>While eyes meet eyes, and look their last farewell.</em>

            <p>Alfred Noyes was a prolific and popular writer who made a living from writing</p>
            <p>when few others could. He was particularly influenced by Tennyson, </p>
            <p>His unique style featured spare and precise poems that experimented 
            <p>Wordsworth, Chaucer, and Shakespeare, and his work often had a Romantic </p>
            <p>and ballad-like style, with optimistic themes inspired by nature. Noyes </p>
            <p>valued traditional English verse and disliked modernist movements, particularly</p>
            <p>the work of James Joyce, though some critics criticized him for </p>
            <p>being resistant to change and literary evolution.</p>
