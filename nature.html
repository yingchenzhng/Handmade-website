              <p>Osip Mandelstam was a significant Russian poet born in Poland</p>
              <p>in the late 1800s, who lived in St. Petersburg with his family. </p>
              <p>He studied abroad in France and Germany and gained acceptance into an exclusive
              <p>Christian institution in St. Petersburg, despite being of Jewish ancestry. </p>
              <p>Mandelstam published his first verse collection, "Stone," which established </p>
              <p>him as one of Russia's upper echelon poets. He identified as an Acmeist,  </p>
              <p>which meant his poetry was rooted in intuition and humanism. However,</p>
              <p>during the rise of the Bolsheviks, Mandelstam refused to compromise his art for political aims, </p>
              <p>political aims,  leading to his alienation from other pro-state artists and intellectuals</p>
