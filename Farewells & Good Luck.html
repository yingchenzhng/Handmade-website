            <em> I'll not weep that thou art going to leave me,</em>
                <em>There's nothing lovely here;</em>
                    <em> And doubly will the dark world grieve me,</em>
                        <em> While thy heart suffers there.</em>

               <em>Must always end in gloom;</em>
               <em>And, follow out the happiest story—</em>
               <em>It closes with a tomb!</em>
               <br>
                    <em>And I am weary of the anguish</em>
                    <em>Increasing winters bear;</em>
                    <em>Weary to watch the spirit languish</em>
                    <em>Through years of dead despair.</em>
                    <br>
                    <em>So, if a tear, when thou art dying,</em>
                    <em> Should haply fall from me,</em>
                    <em>It is but that my soul is sighing,</em>
                <em>To go and rest with thee.</em>

            <p>Emily Brontë's only published poems during her lifetime were included in a slim volume titled Poems</p>
            <p>by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, which sold only two copies and received three reviews. </p>
            <p>The reviews were positive, particularly for the contributions of Ellis Bell, which was </p>
            <p>the pen name for Emily Brontë. Although it seemed that her potential was not fully realized before</p>
            <p>her death in 1848, a collection of nearly 200 of Brontë's poems was later published in</p>
            <p>The Complete Poems of Emily Jane Brontë. The publication of a complete and accurately  </p>
            <p>edited collection of Brontë's poems was delayed due to several factors, including </p>
            <p>Charlotte Brontë's revisions and the wide dispersal of Brontë's manuscripts. The poems range</p>
            <p>from 1836 to 1846 and reveal that Brontë had indeed reached great heights in her poetry</p>
